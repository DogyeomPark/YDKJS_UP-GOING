You need values and types to perform different kinds of actions like math on numbers or output with strings.
You need variables to store data (aka state) during your program's execution.
You need conditionals like if statements to make decisions.
You need loops to repeat tasks until a condition stops being true.
You need functions to organize your code into logical and reusable chunks.
